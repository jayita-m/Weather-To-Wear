This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About ðŸ¤©
This projecta is full-stack web application that suggests weather-appropriate outfits for the day from the user's own inventory. This program is capable of suggesting weather-appropriate outfits for any location, shuffle outfits, and tweet about the user's #OOTD. User can also view their recently uploaded clothing items in an Instagram-like feed.

I worked on both the back-end and the front-end of this application. I utilized Google's Cloud Vision AI to detect logos on branded clothing items, and suggest user to buy more items accordingly. I used Firebase as my backend solution, Weatherbit API for reading the weather, and ReactJS to build the frontend of this interactive app.

Tech Used: Google Vision AI, ReactJS, Firebase, Javascript, Axios

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
